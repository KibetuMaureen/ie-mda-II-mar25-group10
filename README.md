# Cycling in numbers - A Case Study of Cycle Paths in Rhine-Kreis Neuss


Five Counting stations have been permanently documenting cycling traffic on central roads since 2016 in Cycle paths in the Rhine-Kreis Neuss. The daily measurement of cycling traffic is done with the help of induction loops laid in the ground. With the permanent collection of data can gain insights on the daily, weekly and annual cycles and on it building long-term cycling developments over several years.
